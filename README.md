# Brainhurt.org Website

## Introduction
Hello from the Brainhurt Dev Team! We are focused on providing well documented open-source software. Everyone of our team members learned much of their knowledge and skills through open source software, personal blog posts, Github/Bitbucket repositories, etc. - we are commited to giving back to the community that has given us so much! In the interest of keeping that as one of our core values, this repository contains all code required to run [Brainhurt.org](https://brainhurt.org). It also contains build steps + documentation for if you wanted to build our website yourself! 

### Issue Tracking / Feature Requests 
We will use Github for issue tracking and feature requests throughout all of our projects. We will use a public Trello board for 'roadmap' features in each of our products. We encourage anyone and everyone to submit bugs and features! Even better yet, we are open source, why not submit a Pull Request? :) Remember: one typo you fixed is one less bug we have to log, fix, and close ;)


### Building and Contributing 

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Conclusion
As with any of our projects, our goal is knowledge. To further enhance each of our team members skills, but also to help the new guy.  Many open source software organizations have in-line comments and (maybe) some documentation; but that's about it.  There is no such thing as 'too much documentation' at Brainhurt. 

"If every developer wrote 1 extra comment for every 1000 lines of code, how many less questions would be asked?"

As always, if you have any questions/comments/concerns we encourage you to contact us at: support@brainhurt.org

Thanks!
